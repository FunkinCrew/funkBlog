You can email `support@funkin.me` with any inquires relating to backer support such as:

- shipping information assistance
- help with our backer portal ([kickstarter.funkin.me](https://kickstarter.funkin.me))
    - logging in
    - changing your information
    - help getting a new order after a lost-in-transit package

Within your email, include helpful information such as:

- The email you used for Kickstarter
- Your backer number
- Your name you put as your "name in credits"

We will try to get back to you with assistance via the `support@funkin.me` email!

As of writing, it's just one of the devs here helping with emails, so replies might take a couple days to get to.

Very soon we will have a dedicated email support person, hopefully aiming to have quicker response times, 
thank you for your patience!

# Backer Portal

We have a site dedicated for our Kickstarter backers at [kickstarter.funkin.me](https://kickstarter.funkin.me)
where backers edit and modify their information such as:
- credits name changes
- address changes
- general changing survey information
- email address / backer portal account information changes

Again, if you need any assistance with any of that, do reach out at to our support email `support@funkin.me`
