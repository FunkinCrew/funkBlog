  <p>Welcome back everyone to another big Funk Blog Post!!
Today is one from one of the newest faces in town.. me! The mobile lead: Moon.</p>
<p>We're going to be diving into how the mobile port came to light! Start to finish. Hope you're in for a ride, I nerd out with a passion lol. This blog would be part one, mostly about how the team came together, anda few tips and tricks about the mobile port. This post will be more mundane about how we adapted onto the team! No technical shtuff here, we'll get into it in Part 2 hehe.</p>
<p>** Will also give a few facts and tips about the port :)</p>
<h2 id="h2-say-hello-to-the-mobile-team" class="relative">
    <div class="absolute heading-anchor" id="say-hello-to-the-mobile-team"></div>
    Say hello to the mobile team!
  </h2>
  
<p>Okay so first and most importantly: <strong>How did the mobile team form?</strong> Let's see.. this is all coming from my own memory so bare with me here. It started small, just 2 or 3 mobile porters that actually used Funkin's language and engine.. A few I remember are: Lucky, Klav, Roadr, Peppy, and me.. among others I didn't name lol.</p>
<p>It got more and more big, everyone took a swing at mobile porting and ported their own mods, I for one ported a mod practically everyday and uploaded them to YouTube! Yeah, saw those videos before since 2021 to 2023? That's me! Missed me?</p>
<p><img src="/img/2025-07-21/missed_me.png" alt="IMAGE" /></p>
<p>After that... mobile hype slowly died down! But I progressed with programming while the remaining few porters slowly progressed with mobile porting.. Mic'd Up, Psych Engine, Codename.. all had someone who ported it before! Oh especially Psych Engine.
Time skip to 2024 June/July (a year ago!) The creators of Funkin' Android (me and lucky) started working on the weekend 1 fan port.</p>
<p>Then we added a long time friend, Sector.. and then MAJigsaw joins.. then Karim. Among other friends like Sirox and Cub.
Once we moved into a server, we added a few more people to help with gamebanana releases and testing! Kaz helped with testing.. Toffee and Agua helped with testing and releasing.. very fun stuff.</p>
<h2 id="h2-the-start-of-it-all" class="relative">
    <div class="absolute heading-anchor" id="the-start-of-it-all"></div>
    The start of it all..
  </h2>
  
<p>We all worked on the mobile port and then right before release we realized "Wait, we might be good enough for an OFFICIAL mobile port."
All of us needed some sort of income at the time, especially me. So we tried to shoot our ridiculously terrible aim at it.. and landed on Eric's dms.</p>
<p>We had tiny talks here and there, unfortunately the crew was WAY too busy with the game's updates at the time. So, we released our <a href="https://gamebanana.com/mods/514580">fan-made mobile port</a>. It was mid, but at the time it was the best there is lol. Then, on September I talked with Cam.. then I talked with Dave.. and we officially started development on October! We only started with <em>2 months</em> of development originally, but after 2 months passed (and a very rocky road) Dave decided to keep us.</p>
<p>We had to do a bunnnccchhh of stuff backend wise! First, there is making sure the game actually compiles and runs lol. Then, we had to do touch controls.
THIS took months! I had to do a bunch of stuff flixel just didn't have support for! Flicks, movement, drags, swipes, everything.. and it was all done from nothing.
I had to read up on touch backend, actually study something for the first time, and write real life paper notes for that!</p>

    <div class="absolute heading-anchor" id="fitting-in-the-team"></div>
    Fitting in the team
  </h3>
  
<p>When we first got hired, I'll say that the imposter syndrome was felt HARD. Everything we did felt inferior to the holy grail we thought of the Funkin' Crew. I tried keeping up positivity with the others so we wouldn't get stressed out and pressured by our own thoughts.. looking back, it's pretty funny now haha.</p>
<p>I was the only one allowed in the crew's main development group, we had to build up trust again after such a rocky start after-all. But, needless to say it still did the job, I was able to assign tasks to each one of us who could do said-task the best, and in-general we had fun developing. Even having a bunch of inside jokes lol.</p>
<p>One time Karim typo'd a word into "muss". And in vc, I remember laughing so hard I legit rolled on the floor. Muss this, muss that, it was EVERYWHERE. We even nicknamed cam and dave "ninjamussin99" and "muss arcade" i remember.. wish I had the screenshots lol.
Here are some funny moments:</p>

<p><img src="/img/2025-07-21/funny_moments3.png" alt="IMAGE" /></p>
<p>Gonna avoid the boring details for this part but.. after a while we slowly and surely got closer and more confident with the port. We implemented a bunch of stuff in such a short time while the main crew was focusing hard on the content updates at the time! Things like different control schemes.. touch controls.. and slowly moving to more exciting features like Haptics, reviews, in-app purchases, things we NEVER touched before! All of us were forced out of our comfort zones and had to learn something new every now and then.. especially with git.</p>
<p>Thing was mostly smooth rides I'd say, I might be too optimistic but it doesn't hurt to be like that! No harm done. We definitely grew as not only developers, but also people.. it felt surreal working with people that we considered as role models.. then just becoming regular friends with em!</p>
<p>Oh and I remember playing Blazin' (the discord game) with Kade, Eric, and Hundrec. Although the tweet seemed like it was just Eric sharing a screenshot of him playing with friends, but it was happening in the dev vc. Lol.</p>

    During release-month
  </h3>
  
<p>This one was the most fun to be honest, we were crunching, fixing bugs left and right.. it all felt like a really long marathon that we were just about to finish but some of us are falling behind.. yet we are so close. Hundrec's and Abnormal's sorting and task organizing helped with progress a lot, a lot a lot. It was very fun to work with Eric, Kade and Dave among others crunching for mobile release!</p>
<p>I would say it was the best month ever in development so far. Not only did we finish so many things but it was just.. really fun and intense! I remember us fixing multiple game breaking bugs, and being super confident over a "stable" release haha.</p>
<p>Then the release happened, and we found out we missed a few things. Like ads stuff (yuck), and a few bugs here and there. But, overall we were very proud of how things went! Looking at the stats just <em>boosting</em> was really fun. Seeing me and the mobile team's fruits of labour sprout like that was really, really really amazing. Especially for people who never experienced this kind of thing before! As of development for right now though.. since it is very recent..</p>
<p>We are wrapping up 0.7.2 now! I'm sure it'd be out before I release this post I'm sure, but we already fixed a lot of prominent bugs AND adding some more enhancements! Such a short time too! It's just been.. really fun hanging out with everyone and developing funny funky game. Honestly life changing.</p>

  <p>
    <p>The blue touch pointers in the game are both Kevin and Michael.
Kevin being the pointer with an arrow, and Michael being the regular pointer.</p>

    What about the actual mobile port that's out?
  </h3>
  
<p>Okay! Exciting shtuff! I do not want to go too deep otherwise this blog would be too long lol!
Let's see.. the thing people would notice are controls. I've heard several complaints over this and such, dave did make the final design, but I liked it first time I tried it. Funny thing, when we were at earlier stages of development. I was playing with this scheme.. I kept pressing the middle of both strums (left-down and up-right) to hit both notes like an idiot.. then the idea just hit me.</p>
<p>I added that in, completely forgot to tell the crew for about a week lol.. then by pure accident, that gave birth to sliding in the game. And, after discovering it by myself by just being a genuine dumbass, it clicked.</p>
<p><img src="/img/2025-07-21/double_press.png" alt="IMAGE" /></p>
<p>Later around the middle of progress, we had like 50% of the port done.. this image got born. And suddenly, most of the team was able to play the game without being ass at it! I was experienced, like YEARS experienced with the hitbox lanes.. but this? This is something else.</p>
<p>Eventually I was able to do things like this.. (sort of)</p>
<video src="/img/2025-07-21/spookeez_night.mp4" controls="controls" style="max-width: 730px;">
</video>
<p>And, seeing how the community is getting used to this control scheme now, and getting insanely better at it. I will say its almost a success! We just need a very good obvious indicator for sliding and the middle-hitbox..</p>
<p>Flicks, touch controls, swiping, etc. was a doozey to code. It was very insane considering HaxeFlixel does not even provide anything for it! The touch code is very very old!! We had to make all of these functionalities ourselves, it was rough. But, we got through it. Really glad how it turned out haha.</p>

    Outro of the week
  </h2>
  
<p>That's all I have for the blog.. really I am just happy to be here. Seeing everything come together, cub going from tester to the COMPOSER of the trailer music, us going from fan-made port to <em>official</em>. It is just so surreal.</p>
<p>Hopefully with the new additions to the Funkin' Crew. This site will see some life in it. You guys better get your shit ready for the next update ;)</p>
<p>Also <a href="https://fridaynightfunkin.wiki.gg/">Funkipedia</a> moderators, most of the contributors you listed there are ACTUAL developers, love the work you guys been doing, but get it right!! /lh
Honestly though, I love the work you guys have done, you even got my preferred pronouns right, and also a very old post of my child self yelling at his fans lol... don't expose me 'kay?</p>
